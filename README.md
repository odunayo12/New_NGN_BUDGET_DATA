# New_NGN_BUDGET_DATA
This repo consists of Nigerian Budget Data for data accessible period.

## Motivation
I once needed a transparent budget data of Nigeria and found none but some summaries on the internet and pdf file on [Nigerian Budget Office's website](https://www.budgetoffice.gov.ng/index.php/resources/internal-resources/budget-documents). Thus, I decided to covert this pdf's to data with the following additional aims in view:
1. To serve information and decision making needs of people.
2. To provide accessible data for data-analyst enthusiasts.
