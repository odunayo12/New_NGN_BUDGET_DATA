# New_NGN_BUDGET_DATA
This repo consists of Nigerian Budget Data for data accessible period.

## Motivation
I once needed a transparent budget data of Nigeria and found none but some summaries on the internet and pdf files on [Nigerian Budget Office's website](https://www.budgetoffice.gov.ng/index.php/resources/internal-resources/budget-documents). Thus, I decided to covert this pdf's to data with the following aims in view:
1. To serve the information and decision-making needs of people.
2. To provide a locally accessible data for data-analyst enthusiasts.

## Files and Folders
* **/Budget_Data** contains budget data for each year from 2018 to 2020
* **/assets** contains the data wrangling or data cleaning scripts


## To follow:
1. Data in MySql format
2. Detailed Exploratory Analytics and Visualization through blogposts
